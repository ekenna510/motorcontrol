slave sends 
$01EFK000nnn Build date         where 000nnn = slave timecode and Date is compile date of the slave code
slave state=waitstart
motorcontrol sends 
E nn 0          E= echo nn=commandid 0 = off
sets motorcontrol state=1 

slave send E 1 (on old code)
Motorcontrol 
sets state to 2
send P

slave sends $07C %2x S %2x %2x %2x %2x %2x B %2xZ C=compass S 0 sonar address in hex B = baud ubbrl (current slave baud rate)
$07C 00 S 72 79 00 00 00 B 19Z
Motorcontrol 
Create botconfig 
    fail
        set state to 3 if botconfig fails and reset config and sets sonar address
        sends  A S index sonaraddress
    then
    set state = 4 set gain
    sends G %d 80 10 %d = commandid reduces strength of ping

slave 
    motorstate =5 
    sets range and gain
    sends $09Z
    then set to 1 ping and after 100ms set to 2 send output.
motorcontrol
    State = 6
    send H B 3 to start collecting sensors
